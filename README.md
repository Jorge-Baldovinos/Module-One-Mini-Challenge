# Simple Landing Page

## Description

This [Simple Landing Page](https://jorge-baldovinos.github.io/Simple-Landing-Page/) includes a navigation tab with hyperlinks to sites where you can contact the site administrator and also input areas to send your contact information to the administrator. 

## Usage
The hyperlinks are located at the top right-hand side of the page. You can click each of the three options and expect a response except for the portfolio link since a portfolio is still to come. Under the placeholder, you will find a "contact me" section where you can type your name and email to send your contact information to the administrator.
